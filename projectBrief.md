# Project Brief

Connect to an ESXi host via SSH with PHP 7.4, execute some commands, and work with the output of these commands.

Create a modern interface SSH connection form. When the required information is entered into this form and the connect button is pressed, the connection log section immediately below the form should be updated with the result of the command via AJAX.
